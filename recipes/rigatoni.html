    <ol></ol>
    <li>
      <h2>Step 1</h2>
      Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil; stir in the
      rigatoni and cook at a boil uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the
      pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 13 minutes.
      Drain.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Step 2</h2>
      Meanwhile, cook the ground beef, garlic, onion, and bell pepper in a large
      pot over medium-high heat until the ground beef has browned and the
      vegetables are tender, about 7 minutes. Pour in the tomato sauce and
      salsa; season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer. Reduce
      heat to medium-low and continue cooking 15 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Step 3</h2>
      Stir in the Cheddar cheese and cream; cook and stir 3 minutes, then stir
      in the sour cream until evenly blended. Add the drained pasta and stir
      until heated through.
