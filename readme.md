#Odin-Recipes

On thie new project i am creating a recipe which will have different pasta dishes.
After creating the necessary files i have linked the current html file to the original one.

Also adding ingredients and steps of the pasta dishes of each dish.

Linking all the dishes on the main html file which is the index.html file.

The next step is styling my document with css.The first thing to do is creating a css file and linking it with the main html file.

Afterwards i have allocated a section and classes that i will use css to style my document with.

First and foremost i gave my project a universal selector that styles the whole document.

I then went ahead and styled the header which is the scetion of the whole page according to the class i gave it and gave the project a nice backgroung image looking for the right opacity in the rgba colors editting style.

The next part was the navigation bar where i included the links to various recipes of my project.I styled it according to the classes given respectfully.

Starting with the nav links then the image then finally the lists and the links.Giving eacg the needed styles so as to make my project astoinishing.

I also gave a class to my page so as to make it readable on all electronics giving them a max and min width and lso some margin lines.
